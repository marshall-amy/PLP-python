1. Problem Definition (6 points)

Hypothetical AI Problem: Predicting student dropout rates.

Objectives (3):

Identify at-risk students early in the semester.

Improve student retention through targeted interventions.

Provide administrators with actionable insights to allocate support resources.

Stakeholders (2):

University administrators

Students and academic advisors

KPI (1):

Dropout prediction accuracy at Week 4 (percentage of correctly identified at-risk students early in the term).

2. Data Collection & Preprocessing (8 points)

Data Sources (2):

Student academic records (grades, attendance)

Learning management system (LMS) activity logs

Potential Bias (1):

Students with limited internet or device access may appear “less engaged,” leading to biased risk predictions against low-income groups.

Preprocessing Steps (3):

Handle missing values (imputation for attendance gaps).

Normalize continuous features (e.g., assignment submission counts).

Encode categorical variables (major, year level).

3. Model Development (8 points)

Model Choice & Justification:

Random Forest because it handles nonlinear relationships, is robust to noise, and works well with mixed data types.

Data Splitting:

70% training, 15% validation, 15% test to balance learning with hyperparameter tuning and final evaluation.

Hyperparameters to Tune (2):

Number of trees (n_estimators) — controls model complexity and variance.

Maximum depth — prevents overfitting by limiting tree growth.

4. Evaluation & Deployment (8 points)

Evaluation Metrics (2):

F1-score — balances precision and recall for imbalanced dropout datasets.

ROC-AUC — measures ranking ability independent of threshold.

Concept Drift:

Drift occurs when the statistical properties of input data change over time (e.g., new online course formats).

Monitoring: Track model performance metrics weekly and use drift-detection tools (e.g., ADWIN).

Technical Challenge:

Scalability: Serving predictions in real-time for thousands of students may require distributed computing or optimized APIs.

Part 2: Case Study Application (40 points)
Problem Scope (5 points)

Problem: Predict patient readmission risk within 30 days after discharge.

Objectives:

Identify high-risk patients.

Reduce readmission rates and improve care quality.

Assist clinicians in planning follow-up care.

Stakeholders:

Clinicians, hospital administrators, patients.

Data Strategy (10 points)
Data Sources:

Electronic Health Records (EHRs): diagnoses, vitals, medications.

Demographic data: age, sex, socioeconomic status.

Past hospitalization history.

Ethical Concerns (2):

Patient privacy: Sensitive health data must be protected.

Bias: Models may underpredict for underrepresented groups.

Preprocessing & Feature Engineering Pipeline:

Handle missing vitals with median imputation.

Standardize continuous features (e.g., blood pressure).

One-hot encode diagnoses/procedures.

Create derived features such as length of stay, number of prior admissions, medication count.

Model Development (10 points)
Model Choice:

Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost) because it performs well on structured medical data and handles nonlinear interactions.

Deployment (10 points)
Integration Steps:

Containerize model (Docker).

Build API service to serve predictions to EHR systems.

Implement batch or real-time prediction pipelines.

Provide clinician-facing UI dashboards for explanations and alerts.

Monitor performance and data drift.

Regulatory Compliance (HIPAA):

Use encryption for data transfer/storage.

Restrict access using role-based permissions.

Maintain audit logs and perform regular compliance checks.

Ensure no protected health information (PHI) leaves secure environments.

Optimization (5 points)

Address Overfitting:

Apply regularization (L1/L2 or tree depth control) to reduce model complexity.

Part 3: Critical Thinking (20 points)
Ethics & Bias (10 points)

Impact of Biased Data:

If certain patient groups (e.g., minorities or low-income patients) have historically different readmission patterns due to external factors, the model may unfairly assign them high-risk scores, leading to unequal treatment or over-monitoring.

Mitigation Strategy:

Use fairness-aware training, such as reweighting underrepresented groups or auditing model outputs by demographic subgroup.

Trade-offs (10 points)

Interpretability vs Accuracy:

Highly interpretable models (e.g., logistic regression) are easier for clinicians to trust but may fail to capture complex patterns.

More accurate models (e.g., XGBoost, deep learning) can improve predictions but obscure decision logic, reducing clinical transparency.

Limited Computational Resources:

The hospital may opt for lighter models (logistic regression, small random forests) rather than compute-heavy deep learning, trading slight accuracy for efficiency and reliability.

Part 4: Reflection & Workflow Diagram (10 points)
Reflection (5 points)

Most challenging part:

Designing an unbiased data pipeline because healthcare data is messy and ethically sensitive.

Improvements with More Time/Resources:

Collect more granular patient data (e.g., social determinants of health).

Conduct broader fairness audits and clinical validation trials.
