Q1: Edge AI – Reducing Latency and Enhancing Privacy

Explanation:
Edge AI refers to running AI models directly on local devices (smartphones, drones, IoT devices) rather than relying on cloud servers. By processing data locally:

Reduced Latency:

Data does not need to travel to remote servers, so decisions happen in real time.

Example: An autonomous drone detecting obstacles can respond immediately without waiting for cloud inference.

Enhanced Privacy:

Sensitive data remains on-device, minimizing exposure to network interception or cloud storage vulnerabilities.

Example: A wearable health monitor analyzes heart rate anomalies locally, ensuring personal data isn’t uploaded to the cloud unnecessarily.

Real-World Example:

Autonomous Drones: Drones performing package delivery or surveillance can detect obstacles and navigate safely using onboard Edge AI, ensuring quick reactions and data privacy.

Q2: Quantum AI vs Classical AI in Optimization

Classical AI:

Relies on conventional computing and algorithms like gradient descent, genetic algorithms, or simulated annealing.

Handles large optimization problems but may require exponential time for very complex tasks with many variables.

Quantum AI:

Uses quantum computing principles (superposition, entanglement) to explore multiple solutions simultaneously.

Can solve certain combinatorial and optimization problems exponentially faster than classical methods.

Industries Benefiting Most:

Finance: Portfolio optimization, risk assessment, fraud detection.

Logistics: Route optimization for delivery networks or supply chains.

Healthcare: Drug discovery, protein folding, personalized treatment plans.

Energy: Optimizing power grid management and renewable energy distribution.
